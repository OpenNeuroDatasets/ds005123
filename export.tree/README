# Summary
This is a preliminary release of a dataset supported by the National Institutes of Aging and National Insitutes of Health. The full dataset is described in a submission to Data in Brief.


# Abstract
Social relationships change across the lifespan as social networks narrow and motivational priorities shift. These changes may affect, or reflect, differences in how older adults make decisions related to processing social and non-social rewards. While we have shown initial evidence that older adults have a blunted response to some features of social reward, further work in larger samples is needed to probe the extent to which age-related differences translate to real world consequences, such as financial exploitation. To address this gap, we are conducting a 5-year study funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIH R01-AG067011). Over the course of the funding period (2021-2026), this study seeks to: 1) characterize neural responses to social rewards across adulthood; 2) relate those responses to risk for financial exploitation and sociodemographic factors tied to risk; and 3) examine changes in risk for financial exploitation over time in healthy and vulnerable groups of older adults. This paper describes the preliminary release of data for the larger study. Adults (N=114; 40 male / 70 female / 4 other or non-binary; 21-80 years of age M = 42.78, SD = 17.13) were recruited from the community to undergo multi-echo fMRI while completing tasks that measure brain function during social reward and decision-making. Tasks probe neural response to social reward (e.g., peer vs. monetary feedback) and social context and closeness (e.g., sharing a monetary reward with a friend compared to a stranger). Neural response to social decision-making is probed via economic trust and ultimatum games. Functional data, are complimented by a T1 weighted anatomical scan, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to enable tractography. This dataset has extensive potential for re-use, including leveraging multimodal neuroimaging data, within subject measures of fMRI data from different tasks â€“ data features that are rarely see in an adult lifespan dataset. 


# Expanded Task Names
1. *doors and socialdoors*: a task in which participants received well-matched social and monetary rewards and punishment;
2. *ugdg*: a strategic reward-based decision-making task with Ultimatum and Dictator Game conditions
3. *trust*: a task where participants choose an amount to invest in their partner (friend, stranger, or computer) and see wether or not that partner shared the tripled amount back
4. *sharedreward*: a task where participants shared rewards or losses with peers, strangers, or non-human partners


# Additional Usage Notes

We note that participants 10584, 10951, and 11005 are missing dwi. This is due to chiller malfunctions during the sequence that halted data collection. We also note that not all participants have two runs of each task. This was due to time constraints during the scan visits.

Original sourcedata for behavioral data is included in the sourcedata folder. Due to privacy restrictions, we cannot release original sourcedata for the imaging data (i.e., DICOM files).
